       "      <td>You and Me On The Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]\\nThey build wooden houses on frozen ponds\\nIn the summertime when the water's gone\\nDiagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns\\nAnd the sage always smells so pretty\\nBut nobody cares where the birds have gone\\nWhen the rain comes down on Babylon\\nThe stone mason's phone rings all day long\\nAnd you gotta get back to the city\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI'll build my house up on this rock, baby\\nEvery day with you\\nThere's nothin' in that town I need\\nAfter everything we've been through\\nMe out in my garden and you out on your walk\\nIs all the distance this poor girl can take\\nWithout listenin' to you talk\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nJust you and me on the rock\\nYou and me on the rock\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nI built paper planes when I learned to fly\\nLike a 747 fallin' out of the sky\\nI folded 'em crooked, now I'm wonderin' why\\nI could always end up in the water\\nBut nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin\\nWhy she laughin' too hard or why she drinkin' again\\nA fallen star, she's a paper plane\\nShe was goin' down when you caught her\\nYou might also like[Chorus]\\nI'll build my house up on this rock, baby\\nEvery day with you\\nThere's nothin' in that town I need\\nAfter everything we've been through\\nMe out in my garden and you out on your walk\\nIs all the distance this poor girl can take\\nWithout listenin' to you talk\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nJust you and me on the rock\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nIt's an earthquake, it's a harder wind\\nIt's a record breakin' tide and it is rollin' in\\nIt's a big sea, but it can't touch you and me\\nIt's just a water view\\nAnd what a view\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nWoo\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI'll build my house up on this rock, baby\\nEvery day with you\\nThere's nothin' in that town I need\\nAfter everything we've been through\\nMe out in my garden and you out on your walk\\nIs all the distance this old girl can take\\nWithout listenin' to you talk\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nJust you and me on the rock\\n[Outro]\\nI don't need their money, baby (I don't need their money, baby)\\nJust you and me on the rock (Just you and me on the rock)\\nYou and me on the rock1Embed</td>\n",
