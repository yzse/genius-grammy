       "      <td>You and Me On The Rock Lyrics[Verse 1]\\nThey build wooden houses on frozen ponds\\nIn the summertime when the water's gone\\nDiagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns\\nAnd the sage always smells so pretty\\nBut nobody cares where the birds have gone\\nWhen the rain comes down on Babylon\\nThe stone mason's phone rings all day long\\nAnd you gotta get back to the city\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI'll build my house up on this rock, baby\\nEvery day with you\\nThere's nothin' in that town I need\\nAfter everything we've been through\\nMe out in my garden and you out on your walk\\nIs all the distance this poor girl can take\\nWithout listenin' to you talk\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nJust you and me on the rock\\nYou and me on the rock\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nI built paper planes when I learned to fly\\nLike a 747 fallin' out of the sky\\nI folded 'em crooked, now I'm wonderin' why\\nI could always end up in the water\\nBut nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin\\nWhy she laughin' too hard or why she drinkin' again\\nA fallen star, she's a paper plane\\nShe was goin' down when you caught her\\nYou might also like[Chorus]\\nI'll build my house up on this rock, baby\\nEvery day with you\\nThere's nothin' in that town I need\\nAfter everything we've been through\\nMe out in my garden and you out on your walk\\nIs all the distance this poor girl can take\\nWithout listenin' to you talk\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nJust you and me on the rock\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nIt's an earthquake, it's a harder wind\\nIt's a record breakin' tide and it is rollin' in\\nIt's a big sea, but it can't touch you and me\\nIt's just a water view\\nAnd what a view\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nWoo\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI'll build my house up on this rock, baby\\nEvery day with you\\nThere's nothin' in that town I need\\nAfter everything we've been through\\nMe out in my garden and you out on your walk\\nIs all the distance this old girl can take\\nWithout listenin' to you talk\\nI don't need their money, baby\\nJust you and me on the rock\\n[Outro]\\nI don't need their money, baby (I don't need their money, baby)\\nJust you and me on the rock (Just you and me on the rock)\\nYou and me on the rock1Embed</td>\n",

How do you do?\\nNow you're going to die!\"\\nYeah, that's what I told him!\\n\\n[Verse 6]\\nWell, I hit him hard right between the eyes\\nAnd he went down, but to my surprise\\nHe come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear\\nBut I busted a chair right across his teeth\\nAnd we crashed through the wall and into the street\\nKicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer\\n[Verse 7]\\nI tell you, I've fought tougher men\\nBut I really can't remember when\\nHe kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile\\nI heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss\\nAnd he went for his gun and I pulled mine first\\nHe stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile\\n\\n[Verse 8]\\nAnd he said, \"Son, this world is rough\\nAnd if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough\\nAnd I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along\\nSo I give you that name and I said goodbye\\nI knew you'd have to get tough or die\\nAnd it's that name that helped to make you strong\"\\nYeah\\n\\n[Verse 9]\\nHe said, \"Now you just fought one hell of a fight\\nAnd I know you hate me, and you got the right\\nTo kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do\\nBut you ought to thank me, before I die\\nFor the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye\\nBecause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue\"\\n[Verse 10]\\nI got all choked up and I threw down my gun\\nAnd I called him my pa, and he called me his son\\nAnd I came away with a different point of view\\nAnd I think about him, now and then\\nEvery time I try and every time I win\\nAnd if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him\\nBill or George!
